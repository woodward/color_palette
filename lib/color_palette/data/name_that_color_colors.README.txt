# Notes on the data from "name that color"

Only a subset of the colors from [name that color](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#DB5079) 
were used in ColorPalette. Note that in spite of the hex value showing up in the URL, the hex values 
are inserted via Javascript after the page loads so a scrape of their site with Req does not work 
(the value always shows up as "Your Color" in the #colorname ID element on the page as he swaps it 
out after page load for the actual name of the color). So the color names from "name that color" 
were obtained by getting a list of the hex codes in the iex console; 
i.e., 

`ColorPalette.ansi_color_codes |> Enum.map(& &1.hex) `

These were then pasted into the JS console on https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/; e.g., 

hexes = ["000000", "800000", "008000", "808000", "000080", ...]

Then I pasted the following into the JS console:

```javascript
  hexes.forEach(hex => {
    console.log(ntc.name(hex)); 
  });
```

This output was copy/pasted into a JSON file, and some editor fu resulted in the list of names shown 
in `name_that_color_colors.json`.

You can see the JS source here for "name that color" (this is loaded on the page 
https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/).

Note that there are a lot of duplicate names in their list of colors.  Also, there are also only 19 
new color names (see ColorPaletteTest "name that color data"). 

So it was decided to include only the unique "name that color data" in ColorPalette (see 
`name_that_color_unique_colors.json`).
